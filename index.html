                <li><strong>Man In The Mirror</strong> - After Jackson's death, Man in the Mirror became the 
                No. 1 single on Itunes downloads in the United States and the United Kingdom. It is one of 
                Jackson's most critically acclaimed songs and was nominated for Record of the Year at the

                <li><strong>Thriller</strong> - There is no doubt that this song could not be missing in this list. 
                Thriller changed everything, not only for Jackson himself, but also for the music industry in general, 
                the importance of this piece did not end there. The video opened the doors of the MTV network to black 
                artists, as never before had any artist of color starred in any recording in this medium.</li><br>

                <li><strong>Billie Jean</strong> - It is one of his best-known songs, and the one that popularized 
                the famous moonwalk, the dance step that became his trademark. Along with the album Thriller, this 
                song made Jackson the first artist to have a pop single, pop album, R&B single and R&B album at number 
                one simultaneously.</li><br>

                <li><strong>Don’t stop ‘til you get enough</strong> - This song was one of the most important in Jackson's 
                career, it allowed him to win the first Grammy Award, with which he was recognized for 'Best Male R&B Vocal 
                Performance'. </li><br>

                <li><strong>Black or white</strong> - It is considered the best-selling rock song of the 90's, with more 
                than 4 million copies. Thanks to this, it surpassed Billie Jean's sales and managed to stay for 7 weeks 
                in the first position of the Billboard Hot 100, becoming also number one in the charts of more than 20 
                countries. The main objective of the song is to promote racial unity.</li><br>

                <li><strong>Beat It</strong> - This led Jackson to win two Grammy Awards in the categories of Record of 
                the Year and Best Male Rock Vocal Performance. He was inspired to create it during a visit he made to a 
                daycare center in Trenton-New Jersey. Rolling Stone magazine ranked it 337th on its list of the 500 
                greatest songs of all time.</li><br>
